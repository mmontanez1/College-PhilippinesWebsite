      place to be. The historic town of Vigan is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Walk along Crisologo Street to experience

      </p>
      <p></p>Another must-visit destination in Manila is the National Museum of the Philippines. If you like to learn more and
      appreciate the national cultural and historical treasures of the Filipinos, the museum is a place you shouldn‚Äôt miss
      in 2018. See for yourself the giant painting Spoliarium by Juan Luna, the Manunggul Jar and other prehistoric artifacts
      dated back from 890 to 710 B.C., the treasures of Spanish Galleon San Diego, the Balangay or Butuan boat, the different
      paintings and sculptures of various Filipino national artists, and other stuff you have probably only seen in textbooks.
